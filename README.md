    -coursesld_server is presented as an customized interface to publish courses according to those client apps needs. coursesld_client is an client app example presented as a proof of concept
    -coursesld_server is presented as complement of other interfaces such as traditional interfaces (e.g. SPARQL endpoint) and low cost interfaces like Triple Pattern Fragment specificaly to linked university platforms.
    -The automatic client-server communication is because of tecnologies such as: Hydra/Tree included HydraAPIDocumentations and the DCAT 2 metadata vocabulary.
